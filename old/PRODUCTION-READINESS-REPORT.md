## 📝 Technical Notes

### CSS Architecture
The consolidation added utility classes that can be used to replace page-specific duplicated code:
- `.page-hero` - Base hero section styling
- `.card-base` - Standard card component
- `.hover-lift-*` - Hover animations
- `.icon-container` - Icon styling
- `.grid-auto-*` - Grid layouts

### Maintenance Guidelines
1. Use consolidated CSS classes for new pages
2. Avoid duplicating patterns already in `styles.css`
3. Keep page-specific CSS for unique visual elements only
4. Test cross-browser compatibility for new features
